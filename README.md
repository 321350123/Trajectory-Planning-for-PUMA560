# Trajectory-Planning-for-PUMA560
This is a Matlab Program for the trajectory planning of PUMA 560, the known Kinematic Table is shown in kinematicTable.txt

This project is motion planning for PUMA 560 with Kinematic table shown in kinematicTable.txt.
This project is an 3 point example for motion planning; the three points is shown as A, B, C in matlabcode of path_planning.m.
The via point can be changed with applying different value to point A, B, C.
Also there are functions for the forward kinematics and backward kinematics of this robot manipulator provided as forward_Kinematics.m and backward_Kinematics.m.
More details of this project is shown in trajectory_planning_for_PUMA560.pdf.
